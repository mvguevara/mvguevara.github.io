	<p>Martin Guevara is an artist, designer, and pseudo-scientist based in Los Angeles, California. In his practice, Martin works with video, XR (VR/AR), projection mapping and performative data collection to investigate the peripheries of the everchanging human-machine relationship. With a strong background in the fine arts, Martin approaches questions with proper research and data in order to successfully design an appropriate solution. In projects like <i>Please Listen Carefully</i>, he uses a technique he calls, “performative data collection” which re-enacts cybernetic processes through a toll-free phone number. This pseudo-research demonstrates Martin’s ability to create a transparent and contemporary method at uncovering mechanical and cybernetic processes through art, data, and design. Other projects of his include themes of surveillance, cyborg-feminism, machine vision and anti-monumentalism.
