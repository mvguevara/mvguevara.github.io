       		<p><i>AUTOMATED</i>is a fantasy inspired by "A Cyborg Manifesto", one of Donna Haraway's most influential writings. This is also a music video created for <a href="https://arca1000000.com/">ARCA</a>, a Venezuelan recording artist. In the writing, Haraway uses the cyborg as a caveat and a critique of feminism but also calls for responsible bridges between animal, human and machine. The idea of humans as cyborg via medicine and technology are presented in the video. I attempt to mesh footage of automated sight from medical procedures and military use, both in which Haraway explains make us cyborgs. War being a machine and medicine being technology in which we use as a means to survive. This video was initially created to help me possibly understand the writing in a visual sense but has only broadened my own fantasy of the cyborg identity.</p>
